# REACT JS

## What is React JS?

 React JS is an open-source JavaScript library, crafted with precision by Facebook, that aims to simplify the intricate process of building interactive user interfaces. In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface,which, when assembled, it form the application's entire user interface.

 ### Key Feature:
 1. **Component-Base Architecture**: React allows you to break down UI into reusable components.
 2. **Virtual DOM**: React uses Virtual DOM to improve performance.
 3. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: JSX allows you to write HTML like code inside the JavaScript.
 4. **Declarative Syntax**: React's declarative approach make it easy to describe what UI should look like.
 5. **One-Way Data Binding**: React follows a undirectional data flow, meaning that data flows from parent componendt to child components, making it easier to manage.
 6. **React Hooks**: React introduced Hooks in verion 16.8 allowing developers to use state and lifecycle features in functional component.

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** (if you want to clone an existing repository)

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. **Install Node.js and npm**
   - Go to the Node.js website.
   - Download and install Node.js
   - Verify the installation
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm-v
     ```
2. **Install Git(if Not Installed)
   - Go to the Git website.
